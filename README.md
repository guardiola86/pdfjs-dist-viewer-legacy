# PDF.js Minified & Legacy Distribution With Viewer

PDF.js is a Portable Document Format (PDF) library that is built with HTML5.
Its goal is to create a general-purpose, web standards-based platform for
parsing and rendering PDFs.

This is a pre-built version of the PDF.js source code.  I was unable to find
a distribution of PDF.js that was both minified and included the viewer.html
component.  This is essentially just the files produced by running:
`gulp minified` and `gulp generic-legacy` against the upstream repo.

See https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js for learning and contributing.
